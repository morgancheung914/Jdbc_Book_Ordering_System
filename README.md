## Functionality
Our prompt allows users to switch between system, customer, and bookstore interfaces. 

### 1. System Interfaces
   Users can create and delete tables, insert data entries and set the system date.

### 2. Customer Interface
   Users can search books by ISBN, book title and author name. Users can also create, alter and search for orders.

### 3. Bookstore interface 
  Users can update the status of an order, search for orders and popular books (based on the number of orders)
